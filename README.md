# Customer_Churn_Prediction
This project predicts whether a certain customer is more likely to continue using the company's service or not. This would generally help the company as it can take necessary measures to engage at-risk customers, improve customer satisfaction, tailor retention strategies, and ultimately reduce churn rates to maximize long-term revenue and growth.

For this project, I am using this public dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn?select=Customer-Churn-Records.csv in which the target variable is a categorical value. 

Techniques used: Data Cleaning, SMOTE for class balancing,Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
